<h4>Critical-Language Study</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.borenawards.org" target="_blank">Boren Awards</a> of up to $20,000 provide undergraduate and graduate students with unique opportunities to pursue long-term, study abroad experiences to learn any of nearly 60 less-commonly-taught languages that are used in world regions considered critical to U.S. interests. Those regions include countries in Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Boren awards also help to launch careers in international affairs and national security with the federal government; award winners commit to work for the government for at least one year following college graduation.</p>
<p>These scholarships and fellowships—which are considered distinguished scholarships—are named after David L. Boren, principal author of legislation that created the National Security Education Program (NSEP). Sharp works for the Boren program at its main office in Washington, D.C.</p>
<h4>WSU Has Had 17 Boren Award Winners</h4>
<p>Seventeen WSU undergraduate and graduate students have received Boren Awards since 2000, and pursued language studies in China, Taiwan, Russia, Thailand, and Tanzania.</p>
