Gilman International Scholarship from the U.S. Dept. of State to study abroad in Italy in spring 2017.</p>
<p>Perez is one of more than 850 American undergraduates from 359 U.S. colleges and universities who will get up to $5,000 in spring to apply toward the cost of study abroad or an international internship. There were five applicants from WSU for this award in spring.</p><!--more-->
<p>The Gilman award was launched in 2001 to help students gain a better understanding of other cultures, countries, languages, and economies and prepare them to assume future leadership roles in government and the private sector and thrive in the global economy.</p>
<p>“Lysandra’s experiences in Italy will add a great deal to the breadth and depth of her education as well as help her grow both personally and professionally,” said April Seehafer, director of the Distinguished Scholarships Program, part of WSU Undergraduate Education.</p>
<p>“WSU can also be very proud that she is our fifty-fifth Gilman awardee since 2006, which was the first year students from our institution won this nationally competitive scholarship.”</p>
<p>Gilman applicants often receive assistance from individuals and offices across the university that collaborate to support applicants. Students work with faculty, International Programs staff, institutional mentors, and Seehafer’s program as they consider and seek prestigious, nationally competitive awards. For her Gilman, Perez consulted with Global Learning advisors Mayra Villegas and Kate Meyer.</p>
