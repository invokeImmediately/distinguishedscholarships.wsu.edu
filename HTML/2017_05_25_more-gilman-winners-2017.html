<p><img class="shift-to-right spaces-lft-half spaces-btm-qrtr auto-scaled to-33" src="" /><strong>PULLMAN</strong>, Wash.—In addition to a <a href="/2017/03/13/gilman-winner-hare/">student named earlier</a>, four more WSU students have won nationally competitive Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarships to study abroad in summer 2017. A fifth student was named as a Gilman alternate.</p>
<p>The awardees from WSU are among 1,200 American undergraduates from 354 colleges receiving Gilman awards for summer.</p>
<p>WSU’s newest Gilman Scholars are: Anaderi Iniguez, a biology major from Pasco; Rose Kibala, a communications major from Reno, Nev.; Kimberly Marquez, a business management major from Wapato; and Renata O’Connell, a business administration major from Bellingham. They are all headed to Spain, but on three separate trips.</p>
<p>Gilman alternate for summer is Yvette Meza, a senior social sciences major from Royal City. She will study philosophy in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and learn more about that culture.</p>
<h4>Seville with WSU’s First-Generation Abroad</h4>
<p>Marquez and Iniguez, along with previously announced summer Gilman awardee Loundyne “L.D.” Hare, will spend a month as three of 23 WSU students living and studying in Seville, Spain, through WSU’s First-Generation Abroad Program. This advisor-led experience will include university classes, immersion in cultural and language experiences, and regional learning trips, including one across the Strait of Gibraltar to Morocco.</p>
<p>Marquez was raised on the Yakama Reservation in Wapato; her older sister taught her the value of education and being open to opportunities to broaden her life and academic experiences, such as studying abroad.</p>
<p>“Study abroad has always been a distant dream until I acquired the correct educators and resources who supported me and pointed me in the right direction,” she said. As a management major, she believes the experience will help her have better interpersonal and professional skills, making her a more valuable future employee.</p>
<p>Iniguez agrees that experiencing another culture will positively impact her future as an epidemiologist, studying diseases and communicating information to help communities take action to stop the spread of diseases. “I hope to recognize that there is more than one way to solve a problem, and I feel confident that my study abroad will broaden my ability to think critically and creatively.”</p>
<p>[pullOut]Marquez and Iniguez are members of WSU’s <a href="https://firstscholars.wsu.edu/1st-gen-abroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Scholars Program, which is a program partner of First-Generation Abroad</a>. Hare is an Achiever Scholar in the <a href="https://ascc.wsu.edu/academic-services/college-success-scholars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">College Success Foundation</a> program, overseen in WSU’s Academic Success and Career Center (ASCC), part of WSU Undergraduate Education.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled that first-generation students received Gilman Scholarships to make their education abroad this summer possible,” said Eva Navarijo, First Scholars director. “Each will be transformed by living and learning in another country, and will bring back many invaluable personal and academic experiences to share with others.”</p>
<p>The Spain First-Generation Abroad trip is led this summer by program co-director Sharon Ericsson, ASCC assistant director, and Kim Dela Cruz, retention counselor in the Multicultural Student Services office.</p>
<p>“The First-Generation Abroad program is the first custom, advisor-led, study-abroad program in the nation to serve first-generation students exclusively,” said Ericsson. “The professional development and global engagement skills our students will gain on their trip to Spain can impact their grades, graduation rates, and appeal to future employers.”[/pullOut]</p>
<h4>Valencia with the Carson College of Business</h4>
<p>O’Connell is studying abroad in Valencia, Spain on a WSU Carson College of Business faculty-led program. At the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, she will take two courses on global trend forecasting and international special topics taught by WSU faculty.</p>
<p>“The Gilman Scholarship will allow me to pursue a career in Spain and open my eyes to the different business practices and cultures in that part of the world,” she said, noting she is fluent in Spanish and also has ties to the country.</p>
<h4>Barcelona on an Internship</h4>
<p>Kibala is headed to Barcelona, Spain, to be a communications intern at Nau Ivanow, a non-profit performing arts organization. Her internship seminar course and Spanish for business professions course are through IES Abroad-Barcelona.</p>
<h4>“Follow-on” Followups</h4>
<p>The Gilman program requires award recipients to complete a “follow-on service project” when they return to the U.S. to increase awareness of study abroad and of the Gilman Scholarship.</p>
<p>In her application, Kibala described her follow-on project as one involving her talents as a media production student. She plans to create a video of her journey as well as a series of weekly postcard pictures with a story. Her hope is to “inspire all students… I’d like to use myself as an example that it is possible and that a lack of financial resources shouldn’t be a deterrent.”</p>
<p>Marquez plans to share photos and descriptions of her study abroad with participants in the Native American Student Center to “help paint a better picture for Native American students and create more curiosity to study abroad.” She intends to conduct workshops throughout the academic year, and also present at a weekend conference for Native American high schoolers on campus.</p>
<p>Inideri plans to promote study abroad, and information about the financial support available from a Gilman Scholarship, to a variety of student audiences associated with the First Scholars Program, the First-Generation Abroad program, Global Cougs 101 classes, and the Distinguished Scholarships program. She will also share photos from her own experience in Spain, and notes about how she applied for her passport, got around airports, and applied for scholarships.</p>
<h4>Sixty WSU Gilman Scholars</h4>
<p>WSU’s four new Gilman Scholars bring to 60 the number of students who have received the award since 2006. Gilman awards are funded through the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in the U.S. Dept. of State. [pullOut]At WSU, Gilman applicants often receive assistance from individuals and offices across the university that collaborate to support applicants. Students work with <u>Global Learning</u> staff, special organizations, and the <u>Distinguished Scholarships Program</u> to learn about and prepare to apply for these prestigious, nationally competitive awards.  [https://ip.wsu.edu/study-abroad/]  [https://DistinguishedScholarships.wsu.edu]</p>
<p>“Study abroad quite literally opens new worlds to students, and the Gilman award, specifically, helps those who might not otherwise be able to afford the experience,” said Christine Oakley, director of Global Learning, part of International Programs. “Our advisors take great pride and pleasure in helping students study abroad to transform their college experience, future career, and life.”[/pullOut]</p>
