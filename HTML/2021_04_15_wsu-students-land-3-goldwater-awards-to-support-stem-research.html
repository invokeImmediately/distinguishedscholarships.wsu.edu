				<p>“Say a patient has osteoarthritis that is leading to degeneration of their joints,” she said. “I want to find ways to help the patient use their own cells to sometimes repair tissue versus always having to replace it.”</p>
				<p>Her mentored research at WSU has involved evaluating speed and pressure of 3D printing to develop artificial tissue structures, heating and cooling procedures, and developing a hydrogel printing material for culturing cells.</p>
				<p>She became interested in the field of tissue regeneration and engineering after observing nerve-grafting surgery.</p>
				<p>“Why damage one part of the body to fix another, and what if we could use manufactured materials to promote healing?,” she said to herself.</p>
				<p>At North Central High School, she “was interested in everything and just loved learning.” She aimed to become a doctor. A first-generation student, she enrolled in Running Start classes at Eastern Washington University. Then she took a Chemistry 100 class there from faculty Amber McConnell.</p>
				<p>“I loved it, it was awesome, everything made sense. It was a moment in life when something clicks and you know you just have to go with it,” Dykes said.</p>
				<p>She transferred to WSU because of its research reputation, she said, and was thrilled when the faculty members “were all so welcoming.” She was drawn to the work of professors Gozen and Van Wie, using 3D printing to artificially replicate tissue and grow cells in collagen.</p>
				<p>Dykes recently won a top-place crimson award at the <a href="https://SURCA.wsu.edu">Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (SURCA)</a> in the category of engineering and physical sciences for her project, “3D Bioprinted Cartilage Scaffolds with Controllable Mechanical Properties.”</p>
				<p>She plans to continue studies and earn a Ph.D. in bioengineering and work as a biomedical scientist, studying tissue engineering and regenerative medicine “while educating the next generation of medical scientists.” She is the daughter of Arielle and Ron Dykes of Spokane.</p>
				<h3 class="fs--h6 gray-dark-text">Haley Morris: Future Biomedical Sciences Researcher</h3>
				<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_haley-morris_1896w2163h-396x452.jpg" alt="Haley Morris, 2021 Goldwater award winner." width="396" height="452" class="alignright dy--block mw--192px size-medium wp-image-5920" srcset="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_haley-morris_1896w2163h-396x452.jpg 396w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_haley-morris_1896w2163h-792x904.jpg 792w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_haley-morris_1896w2163h-768x876.jpg 768w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_haley-morris_1896w2163h-1346x1536.jpg 1346w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_haley-morris_1896w2163h-1795x2048.jpg 1795w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_haley-morris_1896w2163h-990x1129.jpg 990w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_haley-morris_1896w2163h-1188x1355.jpg 1188w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_haley-morris_1896w2163h.jpg 1896w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" />At Issaquah High School, biology teacher Christopher Foley inspired Morris to see science as a way to solve problems at the cellular and molecular level, she said. She related this awareness to how she could help resolve problems related to cancer.</p>
				<p>“Everyone has, or knows someone who has, been negatively impacted by cancer, and from an early age I’d always said I wanted to help people but I didn’t know how,” Morris recalled. “I realized I could solve problems through science, and that I’d found my passion.”</p>
				<p>Applying to WSU was a family tradition. Her parents are Brenda and Greg (’88 Accounting), and her younger sister Nicole will come to Pullman as a freshman this fall.</p>
				<p>“I loved the opportunities at WSU and the environment. I investigated researchers, talked to Bill Davis (SMB associate dean for undergraduate studies), and was invited to join the <a href="https://admission.wsu.edu/research-scholars/">Research Scholars</a> program for freshmen,” she said. “I got a position in the Wyrick lab investigating the mutagenic effects of UV light on DNA using yeast as a model organism, ultimately looking into melanoma.” Morris is listed <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31390-5">co-author on an article</a> published in 2020.</p>
				<p>She also was invited to join the prestigious <a href="https://smb.wsu.edu/academic-training/undergraduate-studies/stars-program">SMB STARS program (Students Targeted toward Advanced Research Studies)</a> that fast-tracks top biomedical students and includes research lab rotations. Her second rotation was in the Konkel lab, studying the foodborne-illness culprit <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> to determine the mechanism it uses to invade host cells.</p>
				<p>“Thanks to my classes, Research Scholars, and the STARS program, I have discovered how to think like a scientist and have gained confidence in myself and my abilities in a laboratory setting.”</p>
				<p>At SURCA this year, she presented on “Determining the Cause of Diarrheal Disease from a Major Food-borne Pathogen in the U.S.” in the molecular, cellular, and chemical biology category.</p>
				<p>During the COVID-19 international pandemic, when WSU classes were conducted at a distance, Morris was happy to spend 30-40 hours each week in the lab, distancing from others, attending virtual classes on her computer, and doing research.</p>
				<p>In addition to her duties as an officer in her sorority Alpha Delta Pi, she said receiving the Goldwater will help her to further network—she’s already joined its social media group to “talk to like-minded students who are also into science.”</p>
				<p>Morris plans to earn a Ph.D. in biochemistry and pursue a career as a tenure-track professor and biomedical sciences researcher, focusing on cancer and possible therapeutics.</p>
				<h3 class="fs--h6 gray-dark-text">Gunnar Sly: Future Professor and Energy-storage Researcher</h3>
				<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_gunnary-sly_3024w4032h-396x528.jpg" alt="Gunnar Sly, 2021 Goldwater award winner." width="396" height="528" class="alignleft dy--block mw--192px size-medium wp-image-5919" srcset="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_gunnary-sly_3024w4032h-396x528.jpg 396w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_gunnary-sly_3024w4032h-792x1056.jpg 792w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_gunnary-sly_3024w4032h-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_gunnary-sly_3024w4032h-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_gunnary-sly_3024w4032h-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_gunnary-sly_3024w4032h-990x1320.jpg 990w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_gunnary-sly_3024w4032h-1188x1584.jpg 1188w, https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/50/2021/04/portrait_goldwater-winners-2021_gunnary-sly_3024w4032h-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" />Sly worries a lot about climate change, he said.</p>
				<p>“There’s no greater problem that we have. The planet has never undergone such changes as it is now. We can’t just put our foot in the door—we have to work on it. I’m betting that batteries to store renewable energy is a great option—our best option—now and in the future.”</p>
				<p>The son of Tim and Cindy Sly of Spokane Valley, he grew up thinking of engineering as his future career. Two University High School teachers—Mike Conklin, math, and Ken Matheison, chemistry—reinforced Sly’s idea to go into a STEM field—specifically chemical engineering—to “solve problems.”</p>
				<p>WSU was easily his university of choice.</p>
				<p>“I talked to a lot of people, learned of the collaborative atmosphere here, and knew I’d thrive in a cooperative setting. I was offered a <a href="https://admission.wsu.edu/scholarships/scholarship-awards/regents/">Regents Scholarship</a> and a place in the Honors College, which has been a huge part of my fundamental success at college.”</p>
				<p>It was through Honors that he enjoyed a “life-changing” summer research experience at Southeast University in Nanjing, China, working with materials science relating to lithium-ion batteries, the ones often used for energy storage in everything from smartphones to cars. He worked on degradation issues with silicon anodes, and got experience in X-ray diffractometry, electron microscopy, and electrochemical characterization as well as overcoming language and communication barriers.</p>
				<p>Sly enjoyed his time and research so much and appreciated learning to “think globally,” that he plans to return to China within the decade.</p>
				<p>At WSU, he was worked with mentors to develop a process to convert silica to silicon as part of a process to form carbon-covered silica as a high-capacity anode for lithium-ion batteries. A silica source Sly is explored is abundant diatoms which have cell walls composed primarily of silica.</p>
				<p>At SURCA, he presented on “Growth and Utilization of Diatoms in the Creation of High-performance Silicon Anodes for Li-ion Batteries” in the engineering and physical sciences category.</p>
				<p>Sly plans to earn a Ph.D. in chemical engineering and direct a research group and teach undergraduates. He’s getting teaching practice as a peer instructor for an Honors freshman introductory class.</p>
