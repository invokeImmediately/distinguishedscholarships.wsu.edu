			<h3 class="solid">Description</h3>
			<p>The <a href="http://www.fulbright.org.uk/">US-UK Fulbright Commission</a> offers special <a href="http://www.fulbright.org.uk/fulbright-awards/exchanges-to-the-uk/undergraduates">Summer Institutes for US undergraduate citizens</a> to come to the UK on a three, four, five, or six week academic and cultural summer program. Participants will get the opportunity to experience academic training at a highly regarded UK university, explore the culture, heritage and history of the UK and develop their academic ability by improving presentation, research and communication skills. The Summer Institutes cover the majority of participant costs, including round-trip airfare from the US to the UK, tuition and fees at the host university/institution, accommodation and meals and in some cases a small daily allowance.</p>
