			<p class="award-quote">&#8220;Study abroad is a special experience for every student who participates. Living and learning in a vastly different environment of another nation not only exposes our students to alternate views, but also adds an enriching social and cultural experience. It also provides our students with the opportunity to return home with a deeper understanding of their place in the world, encouraging them to be a contributor, rather than a spectator in the international community.&#8221;</p>

			<h3 class="solid">Description</h3>
			<p><a href="https://www.gilmanscholarship.org/program/program-overview/">Gilman awards</a> are for undergraduate study abroad and made to students who are receiving Federal Pell Grant funding at two-year or four-year colleges or universities. By supporting students who might otherwise not participate due to financial constraints, Gilman awards were created to diversify the types of students who apply to study abroad and the countries and regions where they go.</p>
