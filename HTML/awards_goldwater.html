<p class="award-quote">"Equality, rightly understood, as our founding fathers understood it, leads to liberty and to the emancipation of creative differences... My faith in the future rests squarely on the belief that man, if he doesn't first destroy himself, will find new answers in the universe, new technologies, new disciplines, which will contribute to a vastly different and better world in the twenty-first century... To my mind the single essential element on which all discoveries will be dependent is <em>human freedom</em>."</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p class="oue-normal"><strong>The Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Program</strong> was established by Congress in 1986 to honor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater" target="_blank">Senator Barry M. Goldwater</a>. The <a href="https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/" target="_blank">Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship</a> offers one- and two-year awards to college juniors and seniors who intend to pursue careers in math, the natural sciences, or engineering. Awards range up to a maximum of $7,500 annually, covering eligible expenses for tuition, fees, books, and room and board.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>
<p class="oue-normal"><strong>NOTE:</strong> WSU will nominate students following the WSU review process. Students may not apply directly to the Goldwater Foundation.</p>
<p class="oue-normal">For detailed eligibility requirements, please see the <a href="https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/">Goldwater webpage</a>. In general, students should:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Be a United States citizen, a permanent resident, or, in the case of nominees from American Samoa or the Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands, a United States national.</li>
    <li id="gpaReq">Have a college grade-point average of at least "B" (or the equivalent) and be in the upper fourth of his or her class.</li>
    <li>Be a full-time matriculated sophomore or junior during academic year of application (defined as two years or one year of undergraduate study remaining after application year).</li>
    <li>Intend to pursue a research career in mathematics, the natural sciences, or engineering.</li>
</ol>
<p id="gpaReq">At Washington State University, competitive students generally have high grade point averages (typically >3.8) and research experience. The research experience most often includes at least one of the following: some experience outside of WSU, presentations locally and nationally, publications, or other evidence of effective work. Most students will be seeking a Ph.D., but other terminal degrees such as MD/Ph.D., DVM/Ph.D., etc may also qualify if the program is tied to long term research interests.</p>
