<h3>Description</h3>
<strong><a href="http://www.marshallscholarship.org/" target="_blank">Marshall Scholarships</a> provide funding for Americans to study for a graduate degree in the United Kingdom.</strong>

As future leaders equipped with a lasting understanding of British society, Marshall Scholars strengthen the enduring relationship between the British and American people, their governments, and their institutions.

Marshall Scholars are talented, independent, and wide-ranging, and their time as Scholars enhances thier intellectual and personal growth. Their direct engagement with Britain through its best academic programs at 168 higher education institutions in the U.K. contributes to their ultimate personal success.

Up to 40 Marshall Scholarships can be awarded annually. They cover university feels, cost-of-living expenses, an annual book grant, a thesis grant, research and daily travel grants, fares to and from the U.S., and, where applicable, a contribution toward the support of a dependent spouse.
