				<h3 class="solid">Description</h3>
				<p><strong>The <a href="https://www.us-irelandalliance.org/mitchellscholarship">Mitchell Scholarship Program</a> is designed to introduce and connect generations of future American leaders to the island of Ireland,</strong> while recognizing and fostering intellectual achievement, leadership, and a commitment to community and public service. Up to 12 Mitchell Scholars between the ages of 18 and 30 are chosen annually for one year of postgraduate study in any discipline offered by institutions of higher learning in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Applicants are judged on scholarship, leadership, and a sustained commitment to community and public service. Scholarship recipients are provided tuition, accommodations, a living expenses stipend, and an international travel stipend.</p>
				<p>The Mitchell Scholarship is awarded by the US-Ireland Alliance, a proactive, non-partisan, non-profit organization dedicated to consolidating existing relations between the United States and the island of Ireland and building that relationship for the future. The scholarship is named in honor of former United States Senator George J. Mitchell, who served as Chairman of the peace negotiations in Northern Ireland. Senator Mitchell&#8217;s life and career have embodied a deep commitment to public service. The commitment to serve community and country, along with his characteristics of intellectual distinction, leadership, integrity, excellence, and fairness are the qualities sought in Mitchell Scholars.</p>
