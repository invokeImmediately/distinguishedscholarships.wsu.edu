    <p class="award-quote">"My father was the orphaned son of immigrants to the United States from Ireland. My father never knew his parents. His mother died - we're not sure - either at or shortly after his birth, and he and all of his siblings were placed in orphanages in the Boston area... I really owe everything to my parents and their devotion and drive to see to it that their children had the education which led to the opportunities that they never were able to have."</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>The <a href="http://www.marshallscholarship.org/" target="_blank">Mitchell Scholarship Program</a> is designed to introduce and connect generations of future American leaders to the island of Ireland,</strong> while recognizing and fostering intellectual achievement, leadership, and a commitment to community and public service. Up to 12 Mitchell Scholars between the ages of 18 and 30 are chosen annually for one year of postgraduate study in any discipline offered by institutions of higher learning in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Applicants are judged on scholarship, leadership, and a sustained commitment to community and public service. Scholarship recipients are provided tuition, accommodations, a living expenses stipend, and an international travel stipend.</p>
    <p>The Mitchell Scholarship is awarded by the US-Ireland Alliance, a proactive, non-partisan, non-profit organization dedicated to consolidating existing relations between the United States and the island of Ireland and building that relationship for the future. The scholarship is named in honor of former United States Senator George J. Mitchell, who served as Chairman of the peace negotiations in Northern Ireland. Senator Mitchell's life and career have embodied a deep commitment to public service. The commitment to serve community and country, along with his characteristics of intellectual distinction, leadership, integrity, excellence, and fairness are the qualities sought in Mitchell Scholars.</p>
