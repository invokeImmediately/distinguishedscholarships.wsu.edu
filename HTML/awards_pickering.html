				<p>The <a href="http://www.twc.edu/thomas-r-pickering-foreign-affairs-fellowship-program">Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship</a> provides academic and professional preparation for outstanding candidates to enter the U.S. Department of State Foreign Service, representing America’s interests abroad. The Fellowship is a collaborative effort between the United States Department of State, which funds it, and the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, which administers it. The Fellowship is designed to attract outstanding individuals from all ethnic, racial and social backgrounds who have an interest in pursuing a Foreign Service career with the U.S. Department of State. Women, members of minority groups historically underrepresented in the Foreign Service, and students with financial need are encouraged to apply.</p>
				<p>Pickering Fellows are undergraduate and graduate students in academic programs relevant to international affairs, political and economic analysis, administration, management, and science policy. Fellows receive mentoring, professional development, and financial support as they prepare to enter the Foreign Service. Upon successful completion of the Foreign Service examination, Fellows make a commitment to a minimum of five years of service in an appointment as Foreign Service Officer. Accordingly, candidates must be able to obtain medical, security and suitability clearances in order to remain in the program.</p>
