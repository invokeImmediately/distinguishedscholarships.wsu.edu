    <p><a href="http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/rhodesscholarship/about-the-rhodes-scholarships" target="_blank">The Rhodes Scholarships</a> are the oldest and most celebrated international fellowship awards in the world. As explained further by the <a href="http://www.rhodesscholar.org/" target="_blank">website of the American Rhodes Scholarships</a>, 32 young Americans are selected as Rhodes Scholars each year based on outstanding scholarly achievements, character, leadership potential, and commitment to others and to the common good. Full financial support for Rhodes Scholars to pursue a degree or degrees at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom is provided by the <a href="http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/rhodes-trust/trustees" target="_blank">Rhodes Trust</a>, a British charity established to honor the will and bequest of <a href="http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/history" target="_blank">Cecil J. Rhodes</a>.</p>

	<h2 class="fancy with-top-border">Application Process: <br /><span class="has-smaller-text" style="font-family: 'Open Sans Condensed', 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">Multiple Steps with Deadlines over Several Months</span></h2>
	<p class="oue-normal"><strong>Applying for a Rhodes Scholarship is a process.</strong> Throughout, you will gain valuable insights into your interests, strengths, and goals, and more clearly envision how you will represent WSU and the U.S. in meeting the objectives of the scholarship. The WSU Distinguished Scholarships Program will help you coordinate with WSU reviewers, specialists, and experts who will provide thorough application feedback at numerous points in your progression.</p>

            <h3><strong>Step One:</strong> Gather key materials.</h3>
            <h4>Deadline: March 11</h4>
			<p>Well in advance of this date, you must prepare by studying online information about the Rhodes Scholarship and your related accomplishments, and have been in close contact with the director of the WSU Distinguished Scholarships Program. No later than this date, you must schedule a meeting with the director to discuss and submit your:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Draft of a <strong>personal essay</strong> that explains why the Rhodes is the distinguished scholarship that you seek, and are qualified for, this year. As you draft this essay, consider the four criteria by which prospective Rhodes Scholars are selected:<ol>
					<li>Demonstrated devotion to service, moral character, and leadership. In Cecil Rhodes' own words, <strong>“Moral force of character and instincts to lead, and to take an interest in one’s fellow beings.”</strong> These characteristics are developed over your entire time at WSU. Note that meaningful involvement in a few activities is better than a long list of activities.</li>
					<li>Involvement in athletics or other demonstration of <strong>“energy to use one’s talents to the full.”</strong> Varsity sports is not a requirement, but your activities should provide evidence of the physical vigor that will allow a lasting contribution to the world.</li>
					<li>An academic plan that will demonstrate exceptional <strong>“literary and scholastic achievements.”</strong></li>
					<li>Carefully examine your activities and how they display <strong>“truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak kindliness, unselfishness and fellowship.”</strong></li>
				</ol></li>
                <li>Describe your <strong>proposed academic programme</strong>, giving reasons for your desire to study at Oxford.</li>
                <li>Prepare a <strong>finalized list of six-to-eight (6-8) recommenders</strong> (i.e., people who will each write a letter of recommendation for your Rhodes Scholarship application).</li>
