    <h2 id="">Preparation</h2>
    <p>It is never too early to start thinking about a Rhodes Scholarship. Students are encouraged to begin preparation as soon as they arrive on campus.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Carefully determine your eligibility for this scholarship. Familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/rhodesscholarship" target="_blank">Rhodes Scholarship website</a>.<ol>
            <li>Review the <a href="http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/about/faqs" target="_blank">FAQs on the website</a> to answer any specific questions you may have.</li>
            <li>Print a copy of the required application materials (<a href="http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/apply" target="_blank">available online</a>).</li>
        </ol></li><!--
        <li>Attend workshops provided by the Distinguished Scholarships program.<ol>
            <li style="font-size: 12px">Intro to Distinguished Scholarships (provides an introduction to all nationally-competitive scholarships).</li>
            <li>(Fall) Merit based Scholarship Workshop (provides specific information about the Rhodes scholarship).</li>
            <li>Other Workshops, such as the "Writing for Scholarship" workshop or "Award-Winning Résumés" workshop.</li>
        </ol></li>-->
        <li><a href="/contact/">Schedule a meeting</a> with the <a href="/resources/directletter/">Director of the Distinguished Scholarships program</a> and develop a plan for building an application driven by the accomplishments necessary to make it successful (see #6–8 below).</li>
        <li>Develop relationships with faculty and other individuals who you anticipate might be one of your <strong>eight</strong> recommenders. (<i>See <a href="/prepare/">tips for writing references</a>—it will help you understand what to look for in seeking a good recommender.</i>)</li>
        <li>Get in the habit of keeping up with the news. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">New York Times</a> is one excellent source.</li>
        <li>Carefully examine your activities and how you make a difference in the world. Meaningful involvement in a few activities is better than a long list of activities. One of the criteria Rhodes Scholars are judged on is <strong>demonstrated devotion to service</strong>,<strong> moral character</strong>, and <strong>leadership</strong>, and to &ldquo;<strong>take an interest in one's fellow beings</strong>&rdquo;. These characteristics are developed over your entire time at WSU.</li>
        <li>Consider involvement in athletics or other demonstration of &ldquo;<strong>energy to use one's talents to the full</strong>&rdquo;. Varsity sports is not a requirement, but your activities should provide evidence of the physical vigor that will allow a lasting contribution to the world.</li>
        <li>Create an academic plan that will demonstrate exceptional &ldquo;<strong>literary and scholastic achievements</strong>&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Evaluate why you want to study at Oxford.</li>
