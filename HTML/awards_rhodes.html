				<p><a href="http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/rhodesscholarship/about-the-rhodes-scholarships" target="_blank">The Rhodes Scholarships</a> are the oldest and most celebrated international fellowship awards in the world. As explained further by the <a href="http://www.rhodesscholar.org/" target="_blank">website of the American Rhodes Scholarships</a>, 32 young Americans are selected as Rhodes Scholars each year based on outstanding scholarly achievements, character, leadership potential, and commitment to others and to the common good. Full financial support for Rhodes Scholars to pursue a degree or degrees at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom is provided by the <a href="http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/rhodes-trust/trustees" target="_blank">Rhodes Trust</a>, a British charity established to honor the will and bequest of <a href="http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/history" target="_blank">Cecil J.

				<h2 class="fancy with-top-border">Application Process: <br /><span class="has-smaller-text" style="font-family: 'Open Sans Condensed', 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">Multiple Steps with Deadlines over Several Months</span></h2>
				<p class="oue-normal"><strong>Applying for a Rhodes Scholarship is a process.</strong> Throughout, you will gain valuable insights into your interests, strengths, and goals, and more clearly envision how you will represent WSU and the U.S. in meeting the objectives of the scholarship.</p>
				<ul class="application-steps cascaded-layout">
					<li class="cascaded-item">
						<h3><strong>Step One:</strong> Gather key materials.</h3>
						<h4>Deadline: March 11</h4>
						<p>Well in advance of this date, you must prepare by studying online information about the Rhodes Scholarship and your related accomplishments, and have been in close contact with the director of the WSU Distinguished Scholarships Program. No later than this date, you must schedule a meeting with the director to discuss and submit your:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Draft of a <strong>personal essay</strong> that explains why the Rhodes is the distinguished scholarship that you seek, and are qualified for, this year. As you draft this essay, consider the four criteria by which prospective Rhodes Scholars are selected:
								<ol>
									<li>Demonstrated devotion to service, moral character, and leadership. In Cecil Rhodes&#8217; own words, <strong>“Moral force of character and instincts to lead, and to take an interest in one’s fellow beings.”</strong> These characteristics are developed over your entire time at WSU. Note that meaningful involvement in a few activities is better than a long list of activities.</li>
									<li>Involvement in athletics or other demonstration of <strong>“energy to use one’s talents to the full.”</strong> Varsity sports is not a requirement, but your activities should provide evidence of the physical vigor that will allow a lasting contribution to the world.</li>
									<li>An academic plan that will demonstrate exceptional <strong>“literary and scholastic achievements.”</strong></li>
									<li>Carefully examine your activities and how they display <strong>“truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak kindliness, unselfishness and fellowship.”</strong></li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Describe your <strong>proposed academic programme</strong>, giving reasons for your desire to study at Oxford.</li>
							<li>Prepare a <strong>finalized list of six-to-eight (6-8) recommenders</strong> (i.e., people who will each write a letter of recommendation for your Rhodes Scholarship application).</li>
							<li>Update your <strong>résumé or academic vita</strong>.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="cascaded-item">
						<h3><strong>Step Two:</strong> Meet with Director to review submitted materials.</h3>

						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="cascaded-item">
						<h3><strong>Step Three:</strong> Meet with selection committee.</h3>
						<h4>Deadline: early April</h4>
						<ol start="6">
							<li>Application materials will be reviewed by the <a href="/committees/#selection-committee">Distinguished Scholarships Selection Committee</a>. <strong>NOTE:</strong> WSU will only nominate students who are chosen by the reviewers to represent WSU. You will be notified in mid-April whether you will be put forward as a university-nominated applicant for a Rhodes Scholarship.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="cascaded-item">
						<h3><strong>Step Four:</strong> Finalize letters of recommendation.</h3>

						<p>No later than this date, you must make any necessary arrangements for the director of the WSU Distinguished Scholarships Program to receive:</p>
						<ol start="7">
							<li><strong>Final versions of six-to-eight (6-8) letters of recommendation</strong> supporting your scholarship application; each recommender may mail or email their document directly to the program director. Ultimately, five minimum, but no more than eight letters of recommendation will be submitted on your behalf. At least four of these must be from persons whom you have received undergraduate or graduate instruction, and at least one letter (the fifth) must speak to your character.</li>
						</ol>

					</li>
					<li class="cascaded-item">
						<h3><strong>Step Five:</strong> Have your transcripts sent.</h3>
						<h4>Deadline for receipt: May 31</h4>
						<p>Not later than this date, you must make any necessary arrangements so that the director of the WSU Distinguished Scholarships Program will receive:</p>
						<ol start="8">
							<li><strong>One (1) official transcript from every college/university</strong> where you have received academic credit; the institution(s) must mail or email the document directly to the program director.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li class="cascaded-item">
						<h3><strong>Step Six:</strong> Draft your personal statement.</h3>
						<h4>When: April-July</h4>
						<ol start="9">
							<li>During these months, <strong>you, as a nominee, will prepare your personal statement</strong>. This statement should describe your specific area of proposed study and your reasons for wishing to study at Oxford. The work must be entirely your own and will conclude with the following statement: “I attest that this personal statement is my own work and is wholly truthful. Neither it nor any earlier draft has been edited by anyone other than me, nor has anyone else reviewed it to provide me with suggestions to improve it. I understand that any such editing or review would disqualify my application.”</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Additional information about the personal statement can be found on the <a href="http://www.rhodesscholar.org/applying-for-the-scholarship/" title="_blank">Rhodes Scholarship website</a>.</p>

						</ol>
						<p>You must also make any necessary arrangements for the director of the WSU Distinguished Scholarships Program to receive:</p>
						<ol start="12">
							<li><strong>Your recent portrait.</strong> It must be no larger than two inches wide by three inches tall (2×3) and that is high resolution (no less than 300 dpi). The director will help you arrange for such a photo if you do not have an acceptable one.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The director of the WSU Distinguished Scholarship Program will:</p>
						<ol start="13">
							<li>Confirm with your recommenders that they have completed their letters and submitted them online directly to the Rhodes organization.</li>
