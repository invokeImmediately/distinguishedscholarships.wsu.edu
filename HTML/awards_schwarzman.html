				<h3 class="fancy with-top-border">Description</h3>
				<p><a href="http://schwarzmanscholars.org/" target="_blank">Schwarzman Scholars</a> are selected on the basis of not only their academic aptitude and intellectual ability, but also their leadership potential, entrepreneurial spirit, ability to anticipate and act on emerging trends and opportunities, exemplary character, and desire to understand other cultures, perspectives and positions.</p>
				<p>Courses (taught in English) were developed for students of exceptional caliber and include a core curriculum to help participants better understand the role of China in a globalizing world. Students will also work with faculty advisors and tutors to design a set of individual concentration courses that reflect the scholar’s professional and academic interests. Concentration courses will focus on one of three broad fields; Public Policy, Economics and Business or International Studies.</p>
				<p><strong>Up to 200 Schwarzman Scholarships can be awarded annually.</strong> They cover tuition, fees, room and board, travel to and from Beijing at the beginning and end of the academic year, in-country study tours, required course books and supplies, a Lenovo laptop and smartphone, health insurance, and a modest personal stipend.</p>
