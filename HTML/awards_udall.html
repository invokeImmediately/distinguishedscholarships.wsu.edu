						</ol>
					</li>

				<aside class="article-sidebar">
					<h4>Udall Application Tips</h4>
					<p>After examining the Udall application available online, here are some tips to think about as you prepare your answers and essays.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Goal Statement.</strong> Stating a focused and well-defined career goal is always best.
							<ol>
								<li>If you are interested in the Udall environment category, you should be very focused on a career that is centered on environmental issues.</li>
								<li>In the tribal-policy and health-care categories, a member of a tribe should be committed to giving back to either his or her own tribe or Indian country, in general.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Career Aspirations.</strong> There are many paths to reach a goal, but you should be as specific as possible about yours.</li>
						<li><strong>Programs and activities in high school and college.</strong> You must be able to show through brief descriptions how your programs and activities demonstrate your commitment to reaching your goal, and how long you have been involved in them. It is desirable for you to have one or two activities that show a longer involvement with evidence of increasing leadership responsibilities.</li>
						<li><strong>Research, internships, assistantships, jobs.</strong> If you have any or all of these experiences that are not related to a course, you should be able to describe the goal of your efforts in the context of a big picture. You should also indicate your own role if you were part of a team.</li>
						<li><strong>Leadership.</strong> You should be able to connect your leadership examples with your interests/activities and career goals.</li>
						<li><strong>Clarifying experience that strengthened your commitment</strong> (to the environment, tribal policy, or health care). This experience does not need to be recent, but it should show how your experience helped to bring your interests and goals into a sharper focus.</li>
						<li><strong>Public Service and Community Activities.</strong> These can be paid or unpaid experiences, but they should demonstrate your initiative; describe what you accomplished and why. These should also demonstrate how the experiences affected your future plans.</li>
						<li><strong>Udall Essays.</strong> This should be a critical analysis with a topic that integrates well into your own goals and interests.</li>
					</ol>
				</aside>
				<ol>
