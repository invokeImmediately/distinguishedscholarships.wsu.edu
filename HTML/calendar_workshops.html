			<p>In our interactive introductory workshops, you will get acquainted with several nationally-competitive scholarships available to WSU students. We will explain how many of these scholarships require that you be endorsed by WSU, so attending some of our later workshops is mandatory for students interested in these awardsâ€”plus there are WSU deadlines to meet.</p>
