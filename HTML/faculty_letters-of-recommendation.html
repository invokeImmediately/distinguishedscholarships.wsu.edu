		<h3>Guidelines for <mark class="highlight">Writing Letters of Recommendation</mark></h3></div></section>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to support your student for scholarship. Here are a few tips which may make your job a bit easier.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>First and foremost</strong>, determine whether you know the student well enough to write a stellar letter of recommendation.<ol>
<li>If you do not, it is entirely appropriate, and even advisable, to say no. Since the student will be up against stiff competition, a weak and unimpressive letter of recommendation will be noticeable and is likely to hurt the student's chances.<ol>
<li>If you can help the student strategize other possibilities for recommendation writers, please do.</li>
<li>If you are not sure who to suggest, send the student to the Distinguished Scholarships Program office in CUE 519 and we will discuss their options with them.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If you do know the student well and decide to write a letter, consider the tips below.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Gather background materials:</strong> ask the student for materials that will assist you in writing the strongest letter possible.<ol>
<li>A complete resume.<ol>
<li>Feel free to ask questions about what you receive to determine if it is complete.</li>
<li>Beware of missing details; some students may not yet have significant experience with preparing resumes or keeping good records of their accomplishments.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>A bulleted list of details about the scholarship.</li>
<li>A website for the scholarship.</li>
<li>An explanation from the student about why this scholarship is the best fit for this particular student.</li>
<li>An explanation of how this scholarship fits into the student’s goals and plans for the future.</li>
<li>A timeline for completion for this letter (expect at least one month).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>How to structure the letter:</strong> in an introductory paragraph, tell the reader how you know the student.</li>
<li>In subsequent paragraphs, explain why this student is a good fit for this scholarship.</li>
<li><strong>Write impactfully:</strong> use detail whenever possible (i.e. "This student is in the top 2% of students in my class of …").</li>
<li>Use concrete examples when you are able (i.e. "This student demonstrates the ability to think critically. Recently I noticed that this student…")</li>
</ol>
