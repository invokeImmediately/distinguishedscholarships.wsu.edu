<ul>
	<li>Fellowship is awarded annually to an undergraduate student in disciplines such as botany, landscape architecture, horticulture, wildlife ecology or environmental sciences, or others as appropriate to the mission and needs of the <a href="http://www.ahtrees.org/" target="_blank" title="Visit the homepage of the Yakima Area Arboretum, an urban green space and refuge on 46 acres of cultivated land.">Yakima Area Arboretum</a>.</li>
	<li>Fellowship projects contribute directly to the long-range custodianship, oversight, and guardianship of <a href="http://www.ahtrees.org/collection.htm" target="_blank" title="Explore the collections of the Yakima Area Arboretum.">YAA collections</a>.</li>
	<li>The fellowship mutually benefits YAA and WSU by providing an opportunity for a student to receive support to work on a real-world project under faculty direction that aligns with the evolving priorities, needs and projects of the Arboretum.  The details of the fellowship project will be negotiated among the Fellow, the faculty mentor, and the <a href="http://www.ahtrees.org/about.htm" target="_blank" title="Find out more about the people who run the Yakima Area Arboretum.">YAA Executive Director</a> or his/her designee.</li>

This means multiple trips to Yakima, and fellowship recipient will need to provide their own transportation.
