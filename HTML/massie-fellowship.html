<p class="article-tagline">Applications are now open to undergraduate students for the Massie Family Endowed Fellowship at Yakima Area Arboretum. $2000 is available to award to a fellowship student for the 2016-17 academic year for the program at YAA.</p>
<h3 class="fancy with-top-border">Award Information</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fellowship is awarded annually to an undergraduate student in disciplines such as botany, landscape architecture, horticulture, wildlife ecology or environmental sciences, or others as appropriate to the mission and needs of the Yakima Area Arboretum.</li>
	<li>Fellowship projects contribute directly to the long-range custodianship, oversight, and guardianship of YAA collections.</li>
	<li>The fellowship mutually benefits YAA and WSU by providing an opportunity for a student to receive support to work on a real-world project under faculty direction that aligns with the evolving priorities, needs and projects of the Arboretum.  The details of the fellowship project will be negotiated among the Fellow, the faculty mentor, and the YAA Executive Director or his/her designee.</li>
	<li>The Fellowship recipient is expected to engage on site with the YAA and its staff in order to carry out the project. This means multiple trips to Yakima, and fellowship recipient will need to provide their own transportation. The final product of the fellowship will be shared with the relevant Arboretum staff in addition to the supervising faculty member.</li>
	<li>While the fellowship can only be awarded in the academic year, preliminary work may begin the preceding summer (e.g., summer 2016).</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="fancy with-top-border">Application Process</h3>

	<li>Supervising faculty member evaluates student’s ability to carry out proposal and communicates directly with Dr. Sanchez-Lanier.</li>
	<li>Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, Assistant Vice Provost, and if needed, Undergraduate Education Scholarship Committee, make selection in consultation with YAA staff and donor. Applicants are notified by April 30<sup>th</sup>.</li>
