<p><strong class="lead-in">The Massie Family Endowed Fellowship is made possible by an endowment from <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue">Duward</span><span class="is-qtip">BS '52 Agronomy with honors</span> and the late <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue">Carolyn Massie</span><span class="is-qtip">Former student, Nursing</span></strong> together with their children <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue">Jennifer</span><span class="is-qtip">MS '79 Vocational Technical Education and Teaching Certificate</span>, Jill, <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue">Jeffrey</span><span class="is-qtip">BS '83 Civil Engineering</span>, <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue">Jessica</span><span class="is-qtip">Former student, Food Science</span>, and <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue">Jody</span><span class="is-qtip">BA '90 Education and Teaching Certificate</span>. Duward Massie is the first in his family to earn a college degree. His younger brother, Dale, followed Duward to WSU. In addition to his children who attended WSU, two sons-in-law also attended. Grandchildren of Duward and Carolyn Massie have attended WSU as well.</p>

<p>Duward worked as a plant scientist, using his professional education, talents, and abilities in multiple volunteer roles at the Yakima Area Arboretum (YAA) for over 40 years. The mission of the YAA is "to inspire people of all ages to discover and connect with nature through a diverse collection of trees and shrubs hardy to the Inland Northwest." In Duward's words, "This place is a community treasure." His goal in establishing this fund is to marry the two places he is passionate about, WSU and the YAA, in a relationship that will benefit both.</p>
