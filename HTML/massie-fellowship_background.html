<p><strong class="lead-in">The Massie Family Endowed Fellowship is made possible by an endowment established in 2013 by <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue">Duward</span><span class="is-qtip">BS '52 Agronomy with honors</span> and his wife, the late <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue">Carolyn Massie</span><span class="is-qtip">Former Nursing student,</span></strong> with their children <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue"><strong>Jennifer</strong></span><span class="is-qtip">MS '79 Vocational Technical Education and Teaching Certificate</span>, <strong>Jill</strong>, <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue"><strong>Jeffrey</strong></span><span class="is-qtip">BS '83 Civil Engineering</span>, <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue"><strong>Jessica</strong></span><span class="is-qtip">Former Food Science student</span>, and <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue"><strong>Jody</strong></span><span class="is-qtip">BA '90 Education and Teaching Certificate</span>. The goal of establishing this fund, according to Duward, is to marry the two places he is passionate about (WSU and the YAA) in a relationship that will benefit both.</p>
<p>Duward is the first in his family to earn a college degree. His younger brother, Dale, followed in Duward's path, graduating in 1954. In addition to the Massie's children who attended WSU, two sons-in-law and grandchildren of Duward and Carolyn have been Cougar students, as well.</p>

<p>A career plant scientist, Duward used his professional education, talents, and abilities in multiple volunteer roles at the Yakima Area Arboretum over the course of 40 years. The YAA mission is "to inspire people of all ages to discover and connect with nature through a diverse collection of trees and shrubs hardy to the Inland Northwest." In Duward's words, "This place is a community treasure."</p>
