With financial support from the Opportunity Fund, Ryan took basic Hindi language lessons from <strong>Sumit Karn</strong>, then a student at WSU Everett. Their lessons went beyond language to also cover the personal and cultural knowledge necessary to navigate India, both literally and figuratively. Ryan ultimately received the Fulbright, furthered his research throughout locations in India, and even visited Sumit&#8217;s mother as a guest.</li>

				<h4>Personal, WSU, and National Goals</h4>
			</header>
			<p>Distinguished scholarships include awards, such as the Rhodes, Fulbright, Truman, and Goldwater, typically tied to areas deemed to have critical and strategic importance to our country, such as science and engineering research, national security, public and environmental policy, and globalization. WSU applicants compete against thousands, many of whom are the best and brightest from every major and every year in college and beyond. Award winners from Washington State reinforce the reputation for excellence that the state&#8217;s land-grant institution has earned for more than a century.</p>

				<h4>The Process: Every Applicant Benefits</h4>
			</header>
			<p>Winning a distinguished scholarship opens many new doors both today and tomorrow. While only a small fraction of award-seekers receive these scholarships, it is widely recognized that every student who embarks on the rigorous and often lengthy process of applying reaps invaluable and life-long rewards. <strong>Pursuing these prestigious awards uniquely raises students’ own expectations about what they are capable of, dramatically boosts their self-awareness, helps bring their goals into sharp focus, and fine-tunes a variety of communication skills.</strong></p>

			<p>Throughout the process, great opportunities arise that entail additional expenses beyond tuition and fees that many students cannot afford on their own. <strong>We believe that talented students should never feel discouraged due to their financial situation to attain impactful experiences and pursue national awards.</strong> Accordingly, the Distinguished Scholarships Opportunity Fund is designed to help WSU students cover costs to:</p>
