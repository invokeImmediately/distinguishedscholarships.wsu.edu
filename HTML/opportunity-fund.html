Unfortunately, many students face financial challenges that unfairly limit them while trying to attain these life-changing experiences.</span></p>

				<h4>Personal, WSU, and National Goals</h4>

			<p>Distinguished scholarships include awards, such as the Rhodes, Fulbright, Truman, and Goldwater, typically are tied to areas deemed to have critical and strategic importance to our country, such as science and engineering research, national security, public and environmental policy, and globalization. WSU applicants compete against thousands, many of whom are the best and brightest from every major and every year in college and beyond. Award winners from Washington State reinforce the reputation for excellence that the state&#8217;s land-grant institution has earned for more than a century.</p>

				<h4>The Process: Every Applicant Benefits</h4>

			<p>Winning a distinguished scholarship opens many new doors both today and tomorrow. While only a small fraction of award-seekers receive these scholarships, it is widely recognized that every student who embarks on the rigorous and often lengthy process of applying reaps invaluable and life-long rewards. <strong>Pursuing these prestigious awards uniquely raises students’ own expectations about what they are capable of, dramatically boosts their self-awareness, helps bring their goals into sharp focus, and fine-tunes a variety of communication skills.</strong></p>
