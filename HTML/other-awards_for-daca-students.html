		<p><a href="http://unitedwedream.org/">United We Dream</a> has prepared this list of 10 scholarship resources open for undocumented students. The list includes both awards for which undocumented students are eligible as well as scholarship databases specifically designed to assist undocumented students in finding award opportunities.</p>

		<p>Immigrants Rising maintains a series of scholarships resources for undocumented students that don&#8217;t have U.S. citizenship or legal permanent residency. These resources include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://immigrantsrising.org/resource/list-of-undergraduate-scholarships/">List of undergraduate scholarships</a> that do not require proof of citizenship.</li>
			<li><a href="https://immigrantsrising.org/resource/list-of-graduate-scholarships/">List of graduate scholarships</a> that do not require proof of citizenship.</li>

		</ul>
		<p class="sv--500mx">Note that some of the listed opportunities have regional eligibility requirements that make WSU students ineligible for that scholarship. Many of the scholarships, however, do not have such requirements and are open to WSU students.</p>
