		<p>E4FC maintains a list of scholarships available for immigrant students that don&#8217;t have U.S. citizenship or legal permanent residency. Note that some of the listed opportunities have regional eligibility requirements that make WSU students ineligible for that scholarship; however, many of the scholarships do not have such requirements and are open to WSU students.</p>
