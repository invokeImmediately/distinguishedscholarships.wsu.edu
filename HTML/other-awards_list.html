			<h4>Importance of Pursuing Other Scholarships</h4>
			<p><strong>Part of creating an impressive academic record is building a portfolio of accomplishments, including scholarships awarded to you.</strong> As you become more familiar with the selection criteria of the distinguished scholarships we work with in our program, you will notice that having a &#8220;strong academic record&#8221; is a common consideration. This phrase is a significant term that goes well beyond how you performed in your coursework. By using this language, award organizations are implying they want to see how you are an exceptional student both in the classroom and outside it. <em>Being awarded other scholarships uniquely affirms your academic ability and demonstrates that you have something special to offer as an applicant to help achieve the goals of the awarding organization.</em></p>
			<h4>List of Competitive External Scholarship Opportunities</h4>
			<p>To assist you in the process of building your own record of awards and honors that you can feature in a distinguished scholarship application, we have created the following list of external award opportunities. It is intended to help you find out for yourself about opportunities that fit you best and begin to research and apply for those scholarships.</p>
