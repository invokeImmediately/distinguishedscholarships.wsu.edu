	<p>Applications are now open to WSU undergraduate students for the Massie Family Endowed Fellowship at the <a title="Visit the homepage of the Yakima Area Arboretum, an urban green space and refuge on 46 acres of cultivated land." href="http://www.ahtrees.org/" target="_blank">Yakima Area Arboretum (YAA)</a>. This $2,000 fellowship is available for the 2016-17 academic year. The Massie Fellowship:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Is awarded annually</strong> to an undergraduate.</li>
		<li><strong>Mutually benefits YAA and WSU</strong> by supporting a student's faculty-mentored efforts on a real-world project that aligns with the evolving priorities, needs, and projects of the Arboretum.</li>
		<li><strong>Recipient is expected to engage on site with the YAA</strong> and its <a title="Find out more about the people who run the Yakima Area Arboretum." href="http://www.ahtrees.org/about.htm" target="_blank">staff</a> to carry out the project. This could necessitate multiple trips to Yakima; the fellowship recipient must provide their own transportation. The final product of the fellowship will be shared with the relevant arboretum staff and mentoring faculty member. Please see <a href="#current-projects">the list of possible projects</a> for this year.</li>

<p><strong class="lead-in">The Massie Family Endowed Fellowship is made possible by an endowment established in 2013 by <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue">Duward</span><span class="is-qtip">BS '52 Agronomy with honors</span> and his wife, the late <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue">Carolyn Massie</span><span class="is-qtip">Former Nursing student,</span></strong> with their children <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue"><strong>Jennifer</strong></span><span class="is-qtip">MS '79 Vocational Technical Education and Teaching Certificate</span>, <strong>Jill</strong>, <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue"><strong>Jeffrey</strong></span><span class="is-qtip">BS '83 Civil Engineering</span>, <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue"><strong>Jessica</strong></span><span class="is-qtip">Former Food Science student</span>, and <span class="has-tool-tip span-is-source blue"><strong>Jody</strong></span><span class="is-qtip">BA '90 Education and Teaching Certificate</span>.</p>
<p>The goal of establishing this fund, according to Duward, is to marry the two places he is passionate about (WSU and the YAA) in a relationship that will benefit both.</p>
<p>Duward is the first in his family to earn a college degree. His younger brother, Dale, followed in his path at WSU. In addition to the Massie children who attended WSU, two sons-in-law and grandchildren of Duward and Carolyn have been Cougar students, as well.</p>

<p>A career plant scientist, Duward used his professional education, talents, and abilities in multiple volunteer roles at the Yakima Area Arboretum (YAA) over the course of 40 years—nearly half his life. Known as YAA’s “Dr. Tree-rific,” Duward serves on the organization’s board of directors.</p>
<p>On Arbor Days, he is on hand there to give away many hundreds of seedling trees for visitors to plant at home. According to a newspaper article, Duward said of a tree, “If you get one going it may last beyond your own lifetime.” The article continued that he hopes the legacy he’s planting can last for many generations.</p>
<p>The YAA was established a half century ago, in 1967, by 36 garden clubs. Characterized as an “urban green space and refuge” on 46 acres of land, YAA has been cultivated to feature display gardens and tree collections with 1,000 specimens of trees, forbs, grasses, and shrubs, plus natural areas. The arboretum features nature walks, gardening classes, and architectural structures, and is available for wedding ceremonies, meetings, workshops, and fieldtrips.</p>
<p>The YAA mission is “to inspire people of all ages to discover and connect with nature through a diverse collection of trees and shrubs hardy to the Inland Northwest.” In Duward’s words, “This place is a community treasure.”</p>
