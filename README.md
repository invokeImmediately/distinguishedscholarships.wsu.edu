# distinguishedscholarships.wsu.edu
Project for front-end development of the website of the [WSU Distinguished Scholarships program](https://distinguishedscholarships.wsu.edu).

## Project Description
This project tracks development of the precompiled Less CSS, compiled custom CSS, built custom JS, JSON, and HTML5 code from which pages, posts, forms, and tables belonging to the WSU Distinguished Scholarships Program website are constructed, styled, and rendered more interactive via the [WSUWP platform](https://github.com/washingtonstateuniversity/wsuwp-platform). GitHub projects [WSU-UE---CSS](https://github.com/invokeImmediately/WSU-UE---CSS) and [WSU-UE---JS](https://github.com/invokeImmediately/WSU-UE---JS) are used as submodules for CSS and JS development, respectively.
